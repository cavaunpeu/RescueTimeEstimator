An R package containing a single model that estimates a typical week with [RescueTime](www.rescuetime.com) via the "Poor Man's Dirichlet." This package accompanies a [Shiny app](https://willwolf.shinyapps.io/rescue-time-estimation/) built for this purpose. Because the model is written in [RStan](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan), which itself requires a C++ build step, creating an R package proved the easiest way to deploy it to a [Shinyapps](http://www.shinyapps.io/) server.
